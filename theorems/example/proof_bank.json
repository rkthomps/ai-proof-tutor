An irrational number is a number that cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers. In other words, it cannot be written in the form a/b, where a and b are integers (whole numbers), and b is not equal to zero.\nThe square root of 2 is the number which, when multiplied by itself, gives the number 2.\nSo, the task is to prove that there are no two integers that you can divide (one by the other) to get the square root of 2. If you can prove this, then you have shown that the square root of 2 is irrational."
