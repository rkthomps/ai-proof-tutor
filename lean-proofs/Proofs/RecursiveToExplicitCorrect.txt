Base cases: For n ≤ 1, prove R(n) = 2(3n) + 1. Case 1: Let n = 0. Then by definition R(0) = 3, and 2(30) + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3. Therefore the statement holds. Case 2: Let n = 1. Then by definition R(1) = 7, and 2(31) + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7. Therefore the statement holds. Inductive case: Inductive Hypothesis: Let k be an arbitrary non-negative integer with k > 1. Assume for all integers m such that 0 ≤ m < k, R(m) = 2(3m) + 1. Want to Prove: R(k) = 2(3k) + 1. Proof. Given k > 1, m ∈ {k−1, k−2} satisfies 0 ≤ m < k. Therefore, by the inductive hypothesis, R(k −1) = 2(3k−1)+1 and R(k −2) = 2(3k−2)+1. Substituting into R(k) = 4R(k −1)−3R(k −2), we solve algebraically as follows: R(k) = 4(2(3k−1) + 1) − 3(2(3k−2) + 1) = 4(2(3k−1)) − 1 · (2(3k−1)) + 1 = 3 · 2(3k−1) + 1 = 2(3k) + 1 Therefore, for all k > 1, R(k) = 2(3k) + 1. The proof follows by induction.
