Assume towards a contradiction that at most 14 of the days fall on the same day of the week. Since there are 7 days of the week, that means that there are at most 14(7) = 98 days selected, since none of the 7 days of the week can comprise more than 14 of the selected days. But 104 days were chosen, and there are at most 98 chosen days. 98 < 104, so the proof follows by contradiction.
